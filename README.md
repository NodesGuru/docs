# Nym documentation

This is the Nym platform's documentation. It's built using `hugo` (install instructions for your platform are at https://gohugo.io/).

## Building the site locally

Execute `hugo` from the top-level folder and the site will build. `hugo serve` gives you a hot-reloading webserver running the docs on http://localhost:1313.

## Viewing documentation online

This documentation will eventually live at https://nymtech.net/docs. But until it gets there, the easiest way to view documentation is to go to https://github.com/nymtech/docs/tree/master/content
