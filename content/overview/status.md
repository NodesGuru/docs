We are running a Nym testnet with two main components: **Nym Validator nodes**, and **Nym Mixnodes**.

There's also a **Nym Directory** for PKI and network topology information, and a **HTML Dashboard** showing current network status.

Here's an overview of the entire network. Don't be frightened, we'll explain each piece!

Everything shown in the diagram is currently running on the internet, and you're welcome to try our systems out.

Please note: the mixnet and credentials system have not yet been connected together (so there is not yet the possibility to protect IP-layer traffic when generating credentials). We're working on it!
