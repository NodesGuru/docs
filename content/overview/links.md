Here are some links that may prove handy as you start exploring.

## The Nym Project

* You can chat to us in [Keybase](https://keybase.io). Download the app, then click **Teams -> Join a team**. Type `nymtech.friends` into the team name and hit **continue**. For general chat, hang out in the **#general** channel. Our development takes places in the **#dev** channel. Node operators should be in the **#node-operators** channel to receive notice of system updates or node downtime.
* The [Nym website](https://nymtech.net) has general info on project status and links to learning materials and talks we've given
* The [Nym blog](https://medium.com/nymtech) provides up to date project news and views
* The [Nym docs](https://nymtech.net/docs) tell you how to build and use the Nym platform
* The [Nym Platform](https://github.com/nymtech/nym) code repo contains almost all major parts of the Nym system in one convenient place
* The [Nym Dashboard](https://dashboard.nymtech.net) shows testnet nodes and activity
* You can get a live stream of our testnet mixnode activity by subscribing to the websocket at [wss://directory.nymtech.net/ws](wss://directory.nymtech.net/ws). View it in-browser [here](https://directory.nymtech.net)
* The [Nym Directory](https://github.com/nymtech/nym-directory) has [Swagger Docs](https://directory.nymtech.net/swagger/index.html) with runnable documentation, so you can easily get an overview of available API methods on the directory server
