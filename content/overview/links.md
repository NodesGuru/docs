Here are some links that may prove handy as you start exploring our project:

* The [Nym website](https://nymtech.net) has general info on project status and links to learning materials and talks we've given
* [Nym Mixnode](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/mixnode) code
* [Nym Validator](https://github.com/nymtech/nym-validator) code (soon to be [replaced](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/validator))
* [Nym Directory](https://github.com/nymtech/nym-directory) code
* The [Nym Dashboard](https://dashboard.nymtech.net) shows testnet nodes and activity
* You can get a live stream of our testnet mixnode activity by subscribing to the websocket at [wss://directory.nymtech.net/ws](wss://directory.nymtech.net/ws). View it in-browser [here](https://directory.nymtech.net).
* We have also built an [Electron based GUI Chat](https://github.com/nymtech/demo-mixnet-electron-chat) as an example of mixnet integration in non-Go languages. If you're a JavaScript coder, it's easy to build and run. If you're not, we build regular [releases](https://github.com/nymtech/demo-mixnet-electron-chat/releases/).
* We have built a [QT-based Validator Client](https://github.com/nymtech/qt-validator-client-demo) to demonstrate the use of Coconut anonymous credentials with the Ethereum Ropsten testnet. You can try to build it yourself, or just [download](https://github.com/nymtech/qt-validator-client-demo/releases) it for Mac and Linux.
* The [Nym Directory](https://github.com/nymtech/nym-directory) has [Swagger Docs](https://directory.nymtech.net/swagger/index.html) with runnable documentation, so you can easily get an overview of available API methods on the directory server.
