# The Nym Platform

Nym is a blockchain-based privacy platform. It provides strong network-level privacy against sophisticated end-to-end attackers, and anonymous transactions using blinded, re-randomizable, decentralized credentials.

Our goal is to allow developers to enable their applications with advanced privacy features unavailable in other systems.
