You can try out our running mixnet today using a demo application - a mixnet chat demonstrator.

The chat client runs as both a console-based client, and as an Electron client showing how you'd build something in JavaScript.

If you want to try it, grab the code from the [chat demo Github repo](https://github.com/nymtech/demo-mixnet-chat-client) - build and usage instructions are there. Here's a quick GIF of the console client in action:
