description: "The Nym Mixnet implements a modified version of the network anonymity protocols detailed in the Loopix and Sphinx academic papers. It fulfils a similar function to the onion routing in Tor, in that it provides anonymity against attackers who may be monitoring your network traffic or metadata. However, it offers improved protection against adversaries who can monitor the network in its entirety."
