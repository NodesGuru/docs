Nym validators secure the network with a staking token, defending the network from Sybil attacks. 

They also provide privacy-enhanced credentials based on the testimony of a set of decentralized, blockchain-based issuing authorities. Nym validators use a [signature scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature) called [Coconut](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07344) to issue credentials. This allows PEApps to generate anonymous resource claims through decentralised authorities, then use them with Service Providers.
